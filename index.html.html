                <p>Well, being sceptical is obvious for you but given the knowledge and track record I have,<br> I think I am good at leadership and influencing people leaving an impression on their work and at the same time I dare to take ownership and calculated risk in whatever I do and indulge myself responsibly, and mature enough not to blame others for the consequences of my decisions, ready to learn from my setbacks. <br> I have the ability to foresee, through precise logical calculation, the outcome and impact of my choices many steps ahead, and I can utilize this ability to lead and own, to mark a great impact in the field of product management, which greatly relies on these abilities.</p>
